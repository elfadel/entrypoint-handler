## Entrypoint Handler and Code Generator

This project performs two main tasks:
* First, it autogenerates the eBPF codes based on user requirements.
* Second, it attaches different entrypoints to trace several events based on user requirements.

The autogenerated codes are available in ./entries folder.

## Environment

* OS: Ubuntu 20.10
* Kernel: v5.8

## Known requirements

This project is mainly based on libbpfgo.
See how to install libbpfgo [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/libbpfgo).


## Building and running

```sh
make all
```
The above make will compile the main executable `entrypoint`.
This executable can be run with three main options; each defaulted to false.

```sh
sudo ./entrypoint -generate=<true/flase> -make=<true/false> -attach=<true/false>
```
* `-generate`: based on kernel events to trace, this option will generate one or several eBPF codes.
* `-make`: this option is used to compile autogenerated eBPF code from source to object file.
* `-attach`: load and attach compiled eBPF code to different hooks (kprobe/kretprobe, tracepoints, etc.)
